# Shared Introduction – Foundational Framework

## Pathfinder: AI Learning Compass  
**Guiding parents and students towards thoughtful, independent learning in the age of artificial intelligence**

---

### ◆ Why This Project Exists
Artificial Intelligence is now woven into everyday life, including education. While it offers powerful support, it also carries risks if used passively. The purpose of this project is to help parents and students develop a **new literacy**: learning *with* AI rather than outsourcing thinking *to* AI.  

This literacy is about **agency, resilience, and critical thought**. AI should act as a **compass**, pointing towards understanding—while the learner remains the traveller who walks the path.

### ◆ The Challenge
- **Passive Use:** Copying answers from AI tools may complete homework but undermines learning.  
- **Cognitive Risks:** Over-reliance can narrow aspirations, weaken critical thinking, and reduce independent problem-solving.  
- **The Gap:** Parents often feel “stuck” when helping children, and students may be tempted to bypass effort. Both need guidance on how to use AI responsibly.

### ◆ The Opportunity
Used wisely, AI can:  
▸ Explain difficult concepts in accessible ways.  
▸ Provide practice questions and feedback.  
▸ Help organise ideas and structure assignments.  
▸ Encourage reflection and deeper understanding.  

The key is **metacognitive awareness**—thinking about how we think. This project equips parents and students with frameworks and prompts that keep the human mind in command.

### ◆ The Four Literacy Skills
At the heart of both guides are four universal skills. These apply across subjects and age groups:

✦ **Diagnosis** – Identifying what part of the problem is not understood.  
✦ **Decomposition** – Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable learning steps.  
✦ **Prompt Engineering** – Asking AI for guidance, explanations, or practice rather than direct answers.  
✦ **Critical Evaluation** – Judging whether AI’s output is correct, useful, and aligned with independent thought.

### ◆ Two Guides, One Compass
This project is divided into two complementary guides:  

⬥ **Parents’ Guide:** Helping parents support children from early primary to lower secondary years. Focused on scaffolding learning, not supplying answers.  

⬥ **Students’ Guide:** Helping older students (upper primary and secondary) use AI as a study partner. Focused on independence, integrity, and preparation for original work.  

Both guides share the same foundation but adapt tone and strategies to their audience.

### ◆ The Path Ahead
The **Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass** project is not about replacing teachers, parents, or students’ own effort. It is about creating a **framework for responsible AI use in education**, ensuring that learners grow stronger, more adaptable, and more independent.  

By following these guides, parents and students will learn to:  
▸ Use AI as a tutor, not a shortcut.  
▸ Preserve critical thinking and creativity.  
▸ Transition from AI-assisted learning to independent synthesis.
