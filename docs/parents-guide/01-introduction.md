### ◆ Why This Guide Matters
Helping children with homework can be challenging, especially when concepts are unfamiliar or taught differently from when parents were at school. Artificial Intelligence tools can provide explanations, practice questions, and study support. However, if used passively, they risk replacing the child’s own thinking.

This guide is designed to help parents use AI **responsibly and effectively**. It shows how to turn AI into a **learning compass**—pointing towards understanding, while ensuring the child remains the active learner.

### ◆ The Parent’s Role
Parents are not expected to be subject experts. Instead, their role is to:  
▸ Guide the process of learning.  
▸ Encourage curiosity and resilience.  
▸ Use AI as a supportive tool, not a shortcut.  
▸ Ensure the child explains ideas back in their own words.

### ◆ The Core Principle
**AI guides. Your child decides.**  
The goal is not to complete homework faster, but to help children **understand, practise, and grow**. Parents remain the mentors, ensuring that AI strengthens, not weakens, the child’s independence.
