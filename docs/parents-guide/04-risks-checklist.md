# Parents’ Guide – Risks & Checklist for Responsible AI Use  
**File: `parents-guide/04-risks-checklist.md`**

---

## ◆ Introduction
Artificial Intelligence can be a powerful support for learning, but it is not flawless. Parents must understand the risks of using AI tools for homework and study. This guide highlights those risks and provides a practical checklist to ensure responsible use.  

**Remember:** AI is a compass, not a shortcut. It points towards understanding, but the child must walk the path.

## ◆ Key Risks

### ✦ 1. Incorrect Solutions
▸ AI can sometimes provide wrong answers, even when it sounds confident.  
▸ Mistakes may be subtle (e.g., a maths step skipped, a historical date misquoted).  
▸ Parents should always cross-check with textbooks, class notes, or trusted sources.

---

### ✦ 2. Mismatch with Classroom Teaching
▸ AI explanations may not match the method taught by the teacher.  
▸ For example, a maths problem might be solved using a different approach than the one expected in class.  
▸ This can confuse children if not clarified. Parents should ask: *“Is this how your teacher explained it?”*

---

### ✦ 3. Assumed Resources
▸ AI sometimes assumes access to materials (e.g., lab equipment, specific books) that children may not have.  
▸ Parents should adapt prompts to the child’s actual resources and context.  
▸ Example: Instead of “design a science experiment,” ask: *“Suggest a simple experiment using safe household items.”*

---

### ✦ 4. Passive Use
▸ Copying answers directly from AI undermines learning.  
▸ Children may become dependent on the tool instead of developing their own skills.  
▸ Parents must ensure AI is used for explanation, practice, and reflection—not for completing assignments.

---

### ✦ 5. Narrow Thinking
▸ AI may provide only one perspective or reinforce existing ideas.  
▸ This can limit creativity and critical thinking.  
▸ Parents should encourage children to ask for alternative explanations or examples.

## ◆ Checklist for Responsible AI Use

### ◆ Before Using AI
▸ Ask your child to explain where they are stuck.  
▸ Decide whether the goal is to **understand**, **practise**, or **review**.  
▸ Frame prompts around learning, not answers.

---

### ◆ During Use
▸ Pause after each AI response and discuss it with your child.  
▸ Encourage your child to explain the idea back in their own words.  
▸ Compare AI’s explanation with class notes or textbooks.  
▸ Adapt prompts if the explanation feels too advanced or mismatched.

---

### ◆ After Use
▸ Check that your child can solve a similar problem without AI.  
▸ Ensure the final work (essay, solution, project) is their own.  
▸ Reflect together: *“What did we learn? How did AI help us?”*  
▸ Remind your child that AI is a guide, not the author of their homework.

## ◆ Final Note
This guide is not a perfect solution, and neither is AI. It is a framework to help parents and children use AI responsibly, avoiding the risks of incorrect answers, mismatched methods, and passive learning.  

**AI guides. Your child decides.**
