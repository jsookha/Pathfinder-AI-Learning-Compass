**File: `parents-guide/05-quick-reference.md`**

## ◆ Purpose
AI is a **compass**, not a shortcut.  
Parents guide the process, children do the learning.

---

## ◆ The Four Literacy Skills
✦ **Diagnosis** – Spot where your child is stuck.  
✦ **Decomposition** – Break tasks into smaller steps.  
✦ **Prompt Engineering** – Ask AI for guidance, practice, or explanation, not answers.  
✦ **Critical Evaluation** – Check AI’s response against class notes and ensure your child explains it back.

## ◆ Example Prompts by Subject
▸ **Language:** *“Explain the meaning of [word] in simple terms for a Grade 4 student. Give one example sentence.”*

▸ **Science:** *“Explain the water cycle in simple terms and ask three quiz questions.”*  
▸ **History:** *“Give us a timeline of five key events in South African history, suitable for Grade 7.”*

## ◆ Risks to Avoid
▸ **Incorrect solutions:** AI can be confidently wrong.  
▸ **Mismatch with class methods:** May confuse children if different from the teacher’s approach.  
▸ **Assumed resources:** AI may suggest materials not available.  
▸ **Passive use:** Copying answers undermines learning.  
▸ **Narrow thinking:** AI may give only one perspective.

## ◆ Checklist for Parents
### Before Using AI
▸ Ask your child to explain the problem.  
▸ Decide: is the goal to understand, practise, or review?  

### During Use
▸ Pause after each AI response and discuss.  
▸ Encourage your child to explain back.  
▸ Compare with class notes or textbooks.  

### After Use
▸ Check your child can solve a similar problem without AI.  
▸ Ensure final work is their own.  
▸ Reflect together: *“What did we learn? How did AI help us?”*

## ◆ Final Reminder
**AI guides. Your child decides.**  
Parents are mentors, not answer-providers. Use AI to support curiosity, resilience, and independence.
