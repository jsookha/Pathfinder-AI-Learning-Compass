# Quick Reference
**File: `tertiary-guide/08-quick-reference.md`**

This page provides a **condensed set of prompt starters** drawn from the Tertiary Students’ Guide. Use it as a quick-access tool for study, assignments, research, and test preparation. Always adapt prompts to your context, verify outputs against trusted sources, and ensure your work reflects **your own reasoning and understanding**.

> Remember: AI is a **partner, not a substitute**. Treat prompts as a starting point to explore, organise, and test your knowledge — not as finished work.

## ◆ Assignment Guidance

▸ *“What does ‘critically assess’ mean in an academic assignment? Provide a framework for answering responsibly.”* — All disciplines  
▸ *“Here’s my assignment brief. Break down what each part requires and suggest a structure.”* — All disciplines  
▸ *“How might this assignment relate to the key learning outcomes of a marketing strategy module?”* — Business / Management / Humanities  
▸ *“Using this breakdown, create a four-week action plan in a table with steps, topics, resources, and deadlines.”* — All disciplines  

> Tip: For laboratory or studio-based work (sciences, engineering, arts), include practical steps, prototypes, or experimentation in the action plan.

## ◆ Research & Writing

▸ *“Suggest peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2024 on generative AI in legal research.”* — Law / Humanities / CS  
▸ *“Here is a section from a journal article. Explain it in simpler terms and give me an analogy.”* — All disciplines

## ◆ Integrity Reminders

▸ Never copy-paste AI outputs directly into assignments.  
▸ Always verify references, examples, and factual information.  
▸ Follow your institution’s AI and plagiarism policies.  
▸ Ensure your final work reflects **your own voice, reasoning, and disciplinary standards**.  

> Meta-cognitive tip: After using AI, ask yourself — *“Have I learned from this? Could I explain it independently?”* This habit ensures AI remains a learning partner, not a crutch.
