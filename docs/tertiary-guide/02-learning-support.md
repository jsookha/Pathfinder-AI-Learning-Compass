# Learning Support
**File: `tertiary-guide/02-learning-support.md`**

University study requires more than memorising facts or reproducing lecture slides. Across all disciplines — whether you are studying healthcare, engineering, computer science, the sciences, law, business, accounting, or the arts — you are expected to **understand concepts, apply knowledge, reflect on learning, and make informed decisions**.

Generative AI can support this process when used thoughtfully. It can help you organise ideas, practise retrieval, explore alternative explanations, and reflect on your understanding. Importantly, it should *support* your thinking, not replace it. This section introduces practical, responsible ways to use AI as a learning partner for everyday study.

## ◆ 1. Memory and Recall Techniques

Strong learning depends on being able to **retrieve information**, not just recognise it. AI can help you design memory strategies such as mnemonics, spaced repetition, visualisation, and self-testing.

This is useful across disciplines:

▸ **Sciences & healthcare:** memorising processes, anatomy, pathways, or protocols
▸ **Engineering & computer science:** recalling formulas, algorithms, or system steps
▸ **Law, business, and arts:** remembering theories, frameworks, or historical developments

**Prompt starter:**
*“Suggest techniques to help me memorise the stages of cellular respiration, and provide a practice quiz.”*

You can adapt this prompt to other contexts, for example:

▸ *“…the steps in a clinical assessment”*
▸ *“…the phases of a software development lifecycle”*
▸ *“…key theories in art history”*

The goal is not rote memorisation alone, but building a mental structure that supports deeper understanding.

## ◆ 2. Processing Mind-Dumps

When studying complex topics or juggling multiple tasks, your thoughts can feel scattered. Quickly writing or dictating a “mind-dump” helps externalise your thinking. AI can then help you organise this raw material into clearer themes, gaps, or priorities.

This approach is particularly helpful when:

▸ preparing for exams
▸ planning assignments or projects
▸ synthesising material from multiple lectures or readings

**Prompt starter:**
*“Here is my rough mind-dump on globalisation. Please organise these thoughts into categories and highlight gaps I should explore further.”*

Importantly, the ideas come from *you*. AI simply helps structure them so you can see connections and missing pieces more clearly.

## ◆ 3. AI as a Tutor

AI can simulate the role of a tutor by asking questions, prompting explanations, and giving feedback. This is especially valuable when you don’t have immediate access to a lecturer or study group.

Used responsibly, this helps:

▸ reveal misunderstandings
▸ practise explaining ideas in your own words
▸ prepare for tutorials, labs, or exams

**Prompt starter:**
*“Act as my tutor in microeconomics. Ask me five questions about supply and demand, and give feedback on my answers.”*

This approach also works well for:

▸ **Healthcare:** patient scenarios or clinical reasoning
▸ **Engineering:** explaining design decisions or calculations
▸ **Computer science:** walking through algorithms or code logic

If you struggle to explain something clearly, that’s a signal to revisit the material.

## ◆ 4. Moving from Surface to Deep Learning

Surface learning focuses on memorising definitions or steps. Deep learning involves **analysis, application, comparison, and evaluation**. AI can help you move toward deeper engagement by generating probing questions, analogies, or real-world applications.

**Prompt starter:**
*“What would deep learning look like for the concept of opportunity cost? Provide questions that push me to analyse and apply it.”*

For other disciplines, this might include:

▸ applying a scientific theory to a real experiment
▸ testing how an engineering principle behaves under constraints
▸ evaluating ethical implications of a healthcare decision
▸ interpreting a concept through multiple artistic or cultural lenses

The focus is not on getting “the right answer”, but on strengthening your ability to think flexibly and critically.

## ◆ 5. Discovering What You Already Know

Before starting new material, it helps to identify your existing knowledge. AI can ask diagnostic questions that reveal what you understand well — and where you need to focus.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Ask me questions to reveal what I already know about the French Revolution, and suggest areas I should review.”*

This technique supports efficient studying by:

▸ preventing unnecessary repetition
▸ directing attention to weak spots
▸ increasing confidence through awareness of progress

It is particularly useful before exams, practical assessments, or major projects.

## ◆ 6. Simulated Real-World Scenarios

AI can role-play stakeholders, clients, patients, systems, or historical figures, allowing you to practise applying theory in context. This bridges the gap between abstract knowledge and professional practice.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Act as a CEO in a sustainability meeting. Present your stance on green marketing, and I’ll respond as an intern proposing a new campaign.”*

Other examples might include:

▸ a patient presenting symptoms
▸ a client requesting a technical solution
▸ a system failing under specific constraints
▸ a historical figure responding to a critique

These simulations develop judgement, communication skills, and professional reasoning — all of which are essential beyond university.

## ◆ 7. Reflective Learning Journals

Reflection helps you understand *how* you learn, not just *what* you learn. AI can analyse your reflections to identify recurring themes, assumptions, strengths, and blind spots.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Here are my weekly reflections on market segmentation. Identify patterns and suggest three prompts to deepen my analysis.”*

This can support:

▸ clinical reflection in healthcare
▸ design iteration in engineering
▸ debugging and problem-solving in computer science
▸ conceptual growth in theoretical subjects

Reflection encourages ownership of learning and long-term skill development.

---

## ◆ 8. Lecture Notes and Questions

Lecture notes are often incomplete or messy. AI can help turn rough notes or transcripts into structured summaries, questions, or follow-up reading suggestions.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Here are my notes from today’s psychology lecture. Summarise the key points, generate five practice questions, and suggest one article for further reading.”*

Use this to:

▸ reinforce understanding
▸ prepare for tutorials
▸ identify areas needing clarification

Always compare summaries with original lecture materials to ensure accuracy.

---

## ◆ Responsible Use Reminder

▸ Use AI outputs as **study aids**, not substitutes for your own work.
▸ Treat AI explanations as *hypotheses* to be tested against trusted sources.
▸ Regularly ask yourself: *Could I explain this without AI support?*
▸ Use prompts to **engage more deeply**, not to avoid effort.

By integrating these strategies, you can make AI a genuine partner in your learning journey — one that helps you think more clearly, study more effectively, and build the habits of reflective, independent learners across any discipline.
