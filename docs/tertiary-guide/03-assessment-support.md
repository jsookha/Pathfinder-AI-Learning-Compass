# Assessment Support
**File: `tertiary-guide/03-assessment-support.md`**

University assessments are designed to evaluate more than what you remember. Across disciplines — including healthcare, engineering, computer science, the sciences, law, business, accounting, and the arts — assessments test your ability to **interpret information, analyse ideas, apply theory, justify decisions, and communicate reasoning clearly**.

Generative AI can support assessment preparation by helping you clarify difficult concepts, unpack dense academic texts, and test your understanding. Used responsibly, it becomes a tool for *checking and strengthening your thinking*, not replacing it. This section outlines how to use AI as a learning partner when preparing for assessments.

## ◆ 1. Understanding Theoretical Concepts

Many subjects rely on abstract or technical theories that are difficult to grasp on first reading. AI can help by:

▸ explaining ideas in simpler language
▸ offering metaphors or analogies
▸ comparing related concepts

This is useful for:

▸ **Sciences & engineering:** models, laws, and systems
▸ **Healthcare:** theoretical frameworks guiding practice
▸ **Computer science:** computational concepts and architectures
▸ **Humanities & business:** theories of behaviour, culture, or organisation

**Prompt starter:**
*“Explain the concept of consumer behaviour in simple terms with a practical example.”*
*“Compare the difference between segmentation and targeting in marketing.”*
*“Explain opportunity cost using a metaphor.”*

After reading an AI explanation, ask yourself:

▸ Does this align with my lecture notes or textbook?
▸ Where might this explanation be oversimplified?
▸ Could I explain this concept to someone else?

These questions help ensure understanding rather than surface familiarity.

## ◆ 2. Unpacking Academic Articles

Academic articles often use dense language, specialised terminology, and assumed background knowledge. AI can act as a guide to help you work through challenging sections — without replacing the need to read the article yourself.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Act as my academic tutor. I will paste a section from a journal article. Please:

1. Paraphrase it in simpler terms,
2. Identify and explain key academic terms or theories,
3. Give me an example or analogy to make it clearer,
4. Ask me one or two questions to test my understanding.”*

This approach is especially helpful when:

▸ reading empirical research in sciences or healthcare
▸ interpreting technical papers in engineering or computer science
▸ analysing theoretical or critical writing in the humanities

Always return to the original text after clarification to ensure you engage with the author’s argument directly.

## ◆ 3. Confirming Your Understanding

One of the most effective learning strategies is **self-explanation** — articulating what you think you understand and checking it for accuracy. AI can help by responding to your interpretation and highlighting gaps or misconceptions.

**Prompt starter:**
*“I understand this definition of elasticity to mean that demand changes significantly when price changes slightly. Is this correct?”*

This method supports:

▸ correcting misunderstandings early
▸ refining definitions and explanations
▸ preparing for short-answer or oral assessments

If AI disagrees with your interpretation, treat that as a signal to:

▸ revisit course materials
▸ consult lecture notes or readings
▸ ask your lecturer or tutor for clarification

The goal is not agreement with AI, but alignment with academic standards.

## ◆ 4. Identifying Misconceptions and Weak Reasoning

AI can also be used to stress-test your thinking by pointing out assumptions, logical gaps, or oversimplifications. This is particularly valuable in disciplines where small misunderstandings can lead to major errors.

You might ask:

▸ *“What assumptions am I making in this explanation?”*
▸ *“Where could this reasoning fail in a real-world scenario?”*
▸ *“What common misconceptions do students have about this concept?”*

This practice is useful for:

▸ clinical reasoning in healthcare
▸ systems thinking in engineering
▸ algorithm design in computer science
▸ critical analysis in law, business, and the arts

Learning to identify flaws in your own reasoning is a key academic and professional skill.

## ◆ Responsible Use Reminder

▸ Use AI to **clarify, test, and challenge your understanding**, not to replace reading or independent analysis.
▸ Treat AI explanations as provisional — always verify against authoritative sources.
▸ Remember that assessments reward **your reasoning process**, not just correct conclusions.

Before submitting work or sitting an assessment, ask yourself:

▸ *Could I explain this concept clearly without AI assistance?*
▸ *Do I understand why this answer is correct, not just that it is?*

---

By using AI in this way, you develop confidence rooted in understanding — not dependence. This approach prepares you not only for assessments, but for professional environments where you will be expected to justify decisions, evaluate information critically, and take responsibility for your judgement.
