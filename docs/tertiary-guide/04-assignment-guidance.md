# Assignment Guidance
**File: `tertiary-guide/04-assignment-guidance.md`**

University assignments are designed to assess more than your ability to produce content. Across disciplines — including healthcare, engineering, computer science, sciences, law, business, accounting, and the arts — assignments evaluate how well you **interpret instructions, apply knowledge, justify decisions, and communicate clearly within constraints**.

Generative AI can help you understand what an assignment is asking, organise your approach, and plan your workload. However, it must not be used to generate final answers or complete work on your behalf. This section outlines responsible ways to use AI as a *guide* in the assignment process, not a substitute for thinking or effort.

## ◆ 1. Understanding Academic Verbs

Assignment questions often include specific verbs such as *describe, explain, analyse, evaluate, reflect, critically assess*. These verbs signal the **level of thinking** expected.

Misunderstanding a verb can lead to:

▸ overly descriptive answers when analysis is required  
▸ opinions without justification  
▸ technically correct content that does not address the question  

**Prompt starter:**
*“What does ‘critically assess’ mean in an academic assignment? Provide a framework for answering this question without giving me the answer itself.”*

This applies across disciplines:

▸ **Healthcare:** evaluating treatment options or clinical decisions  
▸ **Engineering:** assessing design trade-offs  
▸ **Computer science:** analysing algorithm efficiency or system architecture  
▸ **Arts & humanities:** critically interpreting texts or artworks  
▸ **Business & accounting:** evaluating strategies, models, or financial decisions  

Understanding the verb ensures your effort is directed appropriately.

## ◆ 2. Breaking Down Assignment Briefs

Assignment briefs often contain multiple layers: task instructions, constraints, criteria, and submission requirements. AI can help you unpack these elements and translate them into actionable components.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Here’s my assignment brief. Please break down what each part requires and suggest a structure to complete it.”*
*(Paste brief here)*

For example, a brief might include:

▸ a clinical case study requiring justification of decisions  
▸ a technical problem with design constraints  
▸ a research essay requiring synthesis of sources  
▸ a creative project with reflective commentary  

AI can help you *see* these components clearly — but you remain responsible for how you address them.

## ◆ 3. Linking Assignments to Learning Outcomes

Learning outcomes explain what a course intends for you to develop — not just knowledge, but skills and judgement. Understanding how an assignment aligns with these outcomes helps you focus on what is being assessed.

**Prompt starter:**
*“How might this assignment relate to the key learning outcomes of a marketing strategy module?”*
*“Which topics from this course are most relevant for solving a branding problem?”*

This approach also works for:

▸ identifying which theories to apply in a science report  
▸ selecting appropriate methods in an engineering task  
▸ choosing relevant cases in a law assignment  
▸ aligning technical choices with objectives in computer science  

Seeing this connection encourages intentional learning rather than task completion.

## ◆ 4. Creating Action Plans

Large assignments can feel overwhelming if approached as a single task. Breaking them into stages helps manage time, reduce stress, and improve quality.

AI can help you create a structured action plan that includes:

▸ research and reading  
▸ skill development  
▸ drafting and revision  
▸ reflection and final checks  
 
**Prompt starter:**
*“Using this assignment breakdown, suggest an action plan for me to follow over four weeks. Present it in a table with: step, description, topics to master, resources needed, and deadline.”*

This mirrors professional project planning:

▸ clinicians preparing case reports  
▸ engineers managing design projects  
▸ software developers planning sprints  
▸ researchers organising studies  

Planning is not a shortcut — it is a transferable professional skill.

## ◆ Responsible Use Reminder

▸ Use AI to **clarify expectations and organise tasks**, not to generate full answers or completed work.  
▸ Adapt AI-suggested structures to suit your discipline, lecturer’s expectations, and personal working style.  
▸ Remember that assessment criteria evaluate *your reasoning and decision-making*, not the elegance of an AI-generated response.  

Before you begin writing, ask yourself:

▸ *Do I understand what is being asked — and why?*  
▸ *Can I explain my planned approach without AI support?*  

---

By using AI to interpret, plan, and organise your assignments, you maintain ownership of your work while benefiting from structured support. These habits not only improve academic performance, but also prepare you for complex tasks and projects beyond university, where clear interpretation and planning are essential.
