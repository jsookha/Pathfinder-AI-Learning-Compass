# Introduction
**File: `tertiary-guide/01-introduction.md`**

Welcome to the **Tertiary Students’ Guide** — a resource designed to help university and college learners use Generative AI responsibly, thoughtfully, and effectively throughout their studies.

Generative AI tools are rapidly becoming part of everyday academic and professional life. Students across all disciplines — from healthcare, engineering, and computer science to law, business, accounting, the sciences, and the arts — are encountering AI not just as a study aid, but as a tool they will likely use in their future careers.

AI can support you in understanding complex theories, exploring multiple perspectives, practising problem-solving, and organising your work. However, it is not a shortcut to bypass learning. Instead, think of AI as a **compass**: it can help orient you, suggest directions, and highlight possibilities — but you must still do the thinking, make the decisions, and walk the path yourself.

University education is not only about producing correct answers. It is about developing judgement, reasoning, ethical awareness, and the ability to apply knowledge in unfamiliar situations. Used well, AI can *strengthen* these skills. Used poorly, it can weaken them.

## ◆ Why this guide matters

▸ **Academic integrity:**
Universities expect independent thinking and original work. While AI can assist with clarification, planning, and practice, submitting AI-generated content as your own undermines learning and may breach academic misconduct policies. This guide helps you understand where AI support is appropriate — and where it crosses a line.

▸ **Critical engagement:**
AI tools can sound confident even when they are wrong, incomplete, or overly simplified. Whether you are interpreting a clinical guideline, analysing a dataset, reviewing a legal case, debugging code, or critiquing a theory, you must be able to question, verify, and contextualise what AI provides. This guide encourages active evaluation rather than passive acceptance.

▸ **Practical support across disciplines:**
Students face cognitive overload — dense readings, complex assignments, tight deadlines, and high expectations. AI can help reduce unnecessary friction by assisting with organisation, clarification, rehearsal, and reflection. This frees up mental energy for deeper learning, problem-solving, and creativity.

▸ **Preparation for professional life:**
Beyond university, many professions already expect graduates to work *with* AI tools responsibly — whether in healthcare decision support, engineering design, financial analysis, software development, research, or creative practice. Learning how to collaborate with AI ethically and critically during your studies prepares you for these realities.

## ◆ How to use this guide

This guide is organised into sections that mirror common challenges in higher education and professional preparation:

✦ **Learning Support:**
Strategies for studying more effectively, including memory techniques, reflective learning, self-testing, and using AI as a tutor. These approaches apply whether you are mastering scientific concepts, technical procedures, theoretical frameworks, or creative processes.

✦ **Assessment Support:**
Tools to help you unpack difficult theories, interpret academic texts, and confirm your understanding — without replacing your own reading, reasoning, or analysis.

✦ **Assignment Guidance:**
Frameworks for breaking down assignment briefs, understanding academic verbs, linking tasks to learning outcomes, and planning your workload. These skills are essential across all faculties, from essays and lab reports to design projects and case analyses.

✦ **Research & Writing:**
Responsible ways to explore academic literature, synthesise sources, practise academic writing, refine drafts, and check referencing — while maintaining your own academic voice and intellectual ownership.

✦ **Test Preparation:**
Using AI to generate practice questions, simulate scenarios, and identify gaps in understanding. The focus is on rehearsal and feedback, not prediction or shortcuts.

✦ **Integrity Checklist:**
Clear reminders and reflective questions to help you avoid plagiarism, comply with institutional policies, and take responsibility for your learning process.

✦ **Quick Reference:**
A condensed set of prompt starters you can adapt to your discipline, task, and learning style.

Each section is designed to be used independently or together, depending on your needs.

## ◆ A note on responsible use

Generative AI is powerful, evolving, and imperfect. Responsible use requires judgement, not just technical skill. As you use AI tools, always:

▸ Cross-check information with trusted academic sources such as textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, official standards, or professional guidelines.  
▸ Use AI outputs as **starting points**, not finished products.  
▸ Reflect on *why* an answer makes sense, not just whether it sounds polished.  
▸ Follow your institution’s specific guidelines on AI use in coursework and assessments.  

Approached thoughtfully, AI can become a **learning partner** — one that supports understanding, strengthens skills, and prepares you for lifelong learning in a rapidly changing world. The responsibility, however, always remains yours.
