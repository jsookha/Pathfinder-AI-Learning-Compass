# Test Preparation
**File: `tertiary-guide/06-test-prep.md`**

Exams and tests are designed to assess your understanding, reasoning, and ability to apply knowledge under constraints — not your ability to reproduce AI-generated answers. Whether you are sitting a multiple-choice test, a problem-solving exam, a case-based assessment, or an oral or practical exam, you are expected to demonstrate *your own thinking*.

Generative AI can support your preparation by helping you practise retrieval, apply concepts in new contexts, and identify gaps in understanding. Used responsibly, AI becomes a rehearsal and feedback tool — not a predictor or shortcut. This section outlines how to use AI to prepare effectively for tests across disciplines.

## ◆ 1. Generating Practice Questions

Practice questions are most effective when they force you to retrieve information from memory rather than reread notes. AI can help you generate varied questions based on your lecture topics or study materials.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Generate five practice questions on the topic of supply and demand, with answers hidden until I ask for them.”*

This can be adapted for:

▸ **Sciences:** definitions, processes, and explanations  
▸ **Engineering:** calculations, design reasoning, and constraints  
▸ **Computer science:** algorithm logic, code tracing, and conceptual questions  
▸ **Arts & humanities:** short analytical or interpretive questions  

The key is to attempt answers *before* viewing feedback.

## ◆ 2. Simulating Real-World Scenarios

Many assessments require you to apply theory to scenarios rather than recall facts. AI can simulate realistic situations that mirror how knowledge is used in practice.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Act as a client in a negotiation about intellectual property rights. I’ll respond as a law student, and you provide feedback on my arguments.”*

Other examples include:

▸ a patient presenting symptoms in a clinical scenario  
▸ a system failing under specific engineering constraints  
▸ a dataset requiring interpretation  
▸ a historical figure responding to a critique  

These simulations help develop decision-making, communication, and justification skills.

## ◆ 3. Reviewing Key Concepts

AI can quiz you on key ideas, definitions, models, or case studies, reinforcing both recall and comprehension.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Ask me ten short-answer questions on the theories of motivation, and correct my responses.”*

This approach helps:

▸ consolidate knowledge  
▸ identify areas of confusion  
▸ prepare for time-limited responses  

If you consistently struggle with certain questions, revisit the underlying concepts before continuing.

## ◆ 4. Practising Application of Knowledge

Exams often test whether you can apply knowledge in unfamiliar contexts. AI can help generate applied questions that push beyond memorisation.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Give me three applied questions that test my understanding of elasticity in real-world markets.”*

This is particularly useful for:

▸ problem-solving in engineering and sciences  
▸ case analysis in healthcare, law, and business  
▸ interpreting scenarios in social sciences and humanities  

Focus on explaining *why* an answer works, not just arriving at it.

## ◆ 5. Identifying Weak Spots

Feedback is most useful when it highlights reasoning gaps. AI can help review your responses and suggest areas for improvement.

**Prompt starter:**
*“Here are my answers to five practice questions on constitutional law. Please mark them as a lecturer would, and suggest areas for improvement.”*

Use this feedback to:

▸ refine explanations  
▸ improve structure and clarity  
▸ strengthen justification  

Always compare AI feedback with marking rubrics or past examiners’ comments where available.

---

## ◆ Responsible Use Reminder

▸ Use AI to **generate practice and feedback**, not to predict actual exam questions.
▸ Treat AI feedback as guidance — not as authoritative marking.
▸ Verify content using lecture notes, textbooks, and past papers.
▸ Remember: exams assess **your reasoning, communication, and judgement** under pressure.

Before the exam, ask yourself:

▸ *Can I explain these ideas clearly without AI support?*
▸ *Do I understand the reasoning behind my answers?*

---

By using AI for rehearsal, simulation, and reflection, you strengthen the skills that exams are designed to assess. These habits also mirror professional practice, where preparation, feedback, and decision-making matter far more than perfect recall.
