# Students’ Guide – Integrity Checklist  
**File: `students-guide/05-integrity-checklist.md`**

## ◆ Introduction
AI can explain, quiz, and guide—but it cannot replace your own effort. True learning happens when *you* practise, reflect, and create. This checklist helps you use AI responsibly, ensuring your work remains independent and authentic.

## ◆ Why Integrity Matters
▸ **Learning is personal:** If AI does the work, you miss the chance to grow your own skills.  
▸ **Teachers can tell:** Work that doesn’t match your voice or ability raises questions.  
▸ **Confidence comes from practice:** Only by solving problems yourself will you be ready for tests, projects, and real‑world challenges.  

**AI guides. You decide.**

## ◆ Risks of Misuse
✦ **Copying answers:** Asking AI to “do the homework” weakens your learning.  
✦ **Mismatch with class methods:** AI may explain differently from your teacher, causing confusion.  
✦ **Over‑reliance:** Depending on AI for every step prevents you from building independence.  
✦ **Skipping synthesis:** Letting AI write essays or projects removes your own voice.

## ◆ Integrity Checklist

### ◆ Before Using AI
▸ Ask yourself: *Do I want to understand, practise, or review?*  
▸ Frame prompts around learning goals, not finished answers.  
▸ Keep your notes and textbooks nearby for comparison.

---

### ◆ During Use
▸ Pause after each AI response and explain it back in your own words.  
▸ Attempt practice questions yourself before checking with AI.  
▸ If AI’s explanation feels different from your teacher’s, note the difference and ask for clarification in class.  

---

### ◆ After Use
▸ Check: *Can I solve a similar problem without AI?*  
▸ Ensure essays, reports, or projects are written in your own words.  
▸ Reflect: *What did AI help me with? What did I learn on my own?*  
▸ If required, acknowledge AI support honestly (e.g., “I used AI to practise questions, but the final work is mine”).  

---

## ◆ Senior Student Guidance
For older students, integrity also means using AI critically:  
▸ Ask AI to challenge your arguments, not write them.  
▸ Use AI to critique drafts, but revise in your own voice.  
▸ Treat AI as a study partner, not a substitute for independent thought.  

**Example Prompt:**  
*"Here is my essay draft. Analyse the logical flow and point out where I make claims without evidence. Do not rewrite—just critique."*

## ◆ Final Reminder
Integrity is about honesty with yourself and your learning. AI can support you, but it cannot replace your effort, creativity, or responsibility.
