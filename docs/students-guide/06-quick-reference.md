**File: `students-guide/06-quick-reference.md`**

## ◆ Purpose
AI is a **compass**, not a shortcut.  
It helps you understand and practise, but the final work must always be yours.

---

## ◆ The Four Literacy Skills
✦ **Diagnosis** – Spot where you are stuck.  
✦ **Decomposition** – Break tasks into smaller steps.  
✦ **Prompt Engineering** – Ask AI for guidance, practice, or explanation, not answers.  
✦ **Critical Evaluation** – Check AI’s response against notes and explain it back in your own words.

## ◆ The Workflow
▸ **Understand:** Ask AI to explain concepts simply.  
▸ **Practise:** Use AI for quizzes and feedback.  
▸ **Create:** Outline essays or projects with AI support, but write them yourself.  
▸ **Review:** Summarise, reflect, and check for gaps.

## ◆ Subject Strategies
▸ **STEM:** *“Show me how to solve this type of problem step by step, but let me do the calculations.”*  
▸ **Humanities:** *“List three causes of World War I, then ask me to explain how they connect.”*  
▸ **Languages:** *“Ask me three comprehension questions about this passage. Critique my reasoning after I answer.”*  
▸ **Creative Arts:** *“Analyse my art project idea and suggest three artists I could research for inspiration.”*

## ◆ Integrity Checklist
▸ **Before:** Decide if you want to understand, practise, or review.  
▸ **During:** Explain AI’s response back in your own words.  
▸ **After:** Check you can solve or write without AI.  
▸ **Always:** Keep your voice and effort at the centre of your work.

## ◆ Final Reminder
**AI guides. You decide.**  
Use AI to strengthen your learning, but let your independence and creativity shine through.
