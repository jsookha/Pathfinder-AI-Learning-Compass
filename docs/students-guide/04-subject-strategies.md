**File: `students-guide/04-subject-strategies.md`**

---

## ◆ Introduction
Different subjects require different ways of thinking. AI can support learning across all areas, but the prompts and strategies must match the subject. This guide provides examples for **STEM, Humanities, Languages, and Creative Arts**, with prompts suitable for both younger and older students.  

Remember: AI is a **compass**. It can point you in the right direction, but you must walk the path yourself.

Each subject has its own way of thinking. AI can help explain, quiz, and guide, but the final step must always be yours.  

▸ Younger students: use AI to clarify and practise.  
▸ Senior students: use AI to test arguments, critique drafts, and strengthen your own voice.  

**AI guides. You decide.**
