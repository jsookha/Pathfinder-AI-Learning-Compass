## ◆ Why This Guide Matters
Artificial Intelligence is now part of everyday life, including schoolwork. It can explain difficult ideas, provide practice questions, and help organise thoughts. But if used carelessly, it can become a shortcut that weakens your learning.  

This guide is designed to help students use AI as a **study partner**, a compass that points towards understanding, while ensuring that *you* remain the one doing the learning.

## ◆ Your Role as a Learner
AI is not here to do your homework for you. It is here to help you:  
▸ Understand concepts more clearly.  
▸ Practise skills with feedback.  
▸ Organise ideas for essays and projects.  
▸ Reflect on what you know and what you need to improve.  

The final work—whether it is a maths solution, a science project, or an essay—must always be **your own**.

## ◆ What You Will Find Here
This guide provides:  
✦ A toolkit of four skills for using AI wisely.  
✦ A step-by-step workflow for learning: Understand → Practise → Create → Review.  
✦ Subject-specific strategies for STEM, Humanities, Languages, and Creative Arts.  
✦ An integrity contract to remind you why independence matters.

## ◆ The Core Principle
**AI guides. You decide.**  
The goal is not to finish homework faster, but to build a stronger mind. AI can support you, but your curiosity, effort, and creativity are what make learning real.

## ◆ Final Note
Think of AI as a **compass**: it can point you in the right direction, but you must walk the path yourself. This guide will show you how to use AI responsibly, so that you become a more confident, independent learner.
