# Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass

**Guiding parents and students towards thoughtful, independent learning in the age of artificial intelligence.**

---

## ◆ Overview

Artificial Intelligence is now part of everyday life, including education. While it can explain complex concepts and organize ideas, its greatest risk is replacing the learner’s own thinking.

**Pathfinder** is a roadmap for navigating this new landscape. It is designed to ensure that AI remains a **compass** that points toward understanding, rather than a vehicle that carries the learner to the finish line without effort.

### Choose Your Path

* **[Parents’ Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=parents-guide/01-introduction.md):** Support for parents of primary and lower-secondary children.
* **[Students’ Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=students-guide/01-introduction.md):** Empowering secondary students to use AI as a responsible study partner.
* **[Tertiary Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=tertiary-guide/01-introduction.md):** Advanced strategies for higher education, focusing on research, integrity, and test prep.

## ◆ Core Principles

The "Compass" is built on four pillars of metacognitive learning:

✦ **Diagnosis** – Identify exactly where the learning gap is.

✦ **Decomposition** – Breaking overwhelming tasks into manageable steps.

✦ **Prompt Engineering** – Crafting inquiries that ask for *guidance*, not *answers*.

✦ **Critical Evaluation** – Validating AI output against trusted sources.

> **AI guides. You decide.**

Pathfinder is a living project born from the need to protect authentic learning in a high-tech world. As this is a new initiative, **your feedback is invaluable.** Whether you are a parent seeing a change in your child's study habits, or a student finding a new way to tackle a difficult subject, I would love to hear your story. If you have suggestions for new "Prompt Playbooks" or workflow improvements, please reach out via email.

## ◆ Acknowledgements

This project synthesizes insights from:

▸ Cognitive psychology and the "desirable difficulties" of learning.

▸ Modern prompt engineering frameworks tailored for pedagogy.

▸ The collective experience of educators navigating the generative AI shift.

**Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass** is not a shortcut; it is a commitment to ensuring that learning remains authentic, independent, and resilient.
