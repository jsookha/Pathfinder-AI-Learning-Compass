# Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass

**Guiding parents and students towards thoughtful, independent learning in the age of artificial intelligence**

---

## ◆ Overview
Artificial Intelligence is now part of everyday life, including education. It can explain concepts, provide practice questions, and help organise ideas. But if used passively, it risks replacing the learner’s own thinking.  

**Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass** is a project designed to help parents and students use AI responsibly. It provides two complementary guides:  

- **Parents’ Guide:** Helping parents support children from early primary to lower secondary years.  
- **Students’ Guide:** Helping older students (upper primary and secondary) use AI as a study partner.  

Both guides are built on the same foundation: AI is a **compass** that points towards understanding, but the learner must walk the path.

## ◆ Core Principles
✦ **Diagnosis** – Spot where the learner is stuck.  
✦ **Decomposition** – Break tasks into smaller steps.  
✦ **Prompt Engineering** – Ask AI for guidance, practice, or explanation, not answers.  
✦ **Critical Evaluation** – Check AI’s response against notes and ensure independent thought.  

**AI guides. You decide.**

## ◆ How to Use
▸ **Parents:** Start with the *Parents’ Guide*. Use the framework and playbook to support your child’s learning without outsourcing thinking.  
▸ **Students:** Start with the *Students’ Guide*. Follow the workflow to understand, practise, create, and review responsibly.  
▸ **Educators:** Explore both guides. Share them with families and students to encourage responsible AI use in learning.  

---

## ◆ Publishing
This repository is designed to be accessible through **GitHub Pages**, providing a clean website view for parents and students. A mirrored version may also be hosted on a personal site for redundancy.

---

## ◆ Acknowledgements
This project builds on insights from:  
▸ Cognitive psychology research into AI’s impact on learning.  
▸ Practical frameworks for metacognitive awareness and responsible technology use.  
▸ Real-world experiences of parents, students, and educators navigating AI in education.

## ◆ Final Note
Pathfinder – AI Learning Compass is not a perfect solution, and neither is AI. It is a guide to help families and students use AI responsibly, ensuring that learning remains authentic, independent, and resilient.  

**AI guides. You decide.**
