This guide encourages active evaluation rather than passive acceptance.</p> <p>\u25b8 Practical support across disciplines: Students face cognitive overload \u2014 dense readings, complex assignments, tight deadlines, and high expectations. AI can help reduce unnecessary friction by assisting with organisation, clarification, rehearsal, and reflection. This frees up mental energy for deeper learning, problem-solving, and creativity.</p> <p>\u25b8 Preparation for professional life: Beyond university, many professions already expect graduates to work with AI tools responsibly \u2014 whether in healthcare decision support, engineering design, financial analysis, software development, research, or creative practice. Learning how to collaborate with AI ethically and critically during your studies prepares you for these realities.</p>"},{"location":"tertiary-guide/01-introduction/#how-to-use-this-guide","title":"\u25c6 How to use this guide","text":"<p>This guide is organised into sections that mirror common challenges in higher education and professional preparation:</p> <p>\u2726 Learning Support: Strategies for studying more effectively, including memory techniques, reflective learning, self-testing, and using AI as a tutor.
