# Students’ Guide – Workflow for Learning with AI  
**File: `students-guide/03-workflow.md`**

## ◆ Introduction
AI can be a helpful study partner, but only if you use it as part of a clear process. This workflow shows you how to move from **confusion to mastery** in four phases:  

▸ **Understand → Practise → Create → Review**  

Younger students can use this as a simple routine. Older students can apply it more deeply, using AI to test arguments, critique drafts, and strengthen independent work.

---

## ◆ Phase 1: Understand
**Goal:** Build clarity on the topic.  

▸ Ask AI to explain concepts in simple terms.  
▸ Request analogies or real‑world examples.  
▸ Stop and check: *Can I explain this back without looking?*  

**Example Prompts:**  
- *“Explain photosynthesis in simple steps for a Grade 6 student. Give one everyday example.”*  
- *Senior level:* *“Explain the role of enzymes in photosynthesis, and compare it with cellular respiration.”*

---

## ◆ Phase 2: Practise
**Goal:** Strengthen skills through repetition and feedback.  

▸ Ask AI to quiz you with practice questions.  
▸ Attempt the answers yourself before checking.  
▸ Use mistakes as learning opportunities.  

**Example Prompts:**  
- *“Ask me five practice questions on fractions. Wait for my answers before giving feedback.”*  
- *Senior level:* *“Give me three short‑answer questions on Shakespeare’s Macbeth. After I answer, critique my reasoning.”*

## ◆ Phase 3: Create
**Goal:** Apply knowledge to produce your own work.  

▸ Use AI to help outline essays, projects, or solutions.  
▸ Ask for counter‑arguments or alternative perspectives.  
▸ Ensure the final writing, solution, or design is your own.  

**Example Prompts:**  
- *“Help me outline a book report on Charlotte’s Web. Suggest three main points I could include.”*  
- *Senior level:* *“Based on our discussion of World War II causes, generate three possible thesis statements. Then suggest counter‑arguments I should address.”*

## ◆ Phase 4: Review
**Goal:** Reflect and refine your learning.  

▸ Summarise what you’ve learned.  
▸ Ask AI to highlight gaps or missing details.  
▸ Compare with your notes and teacher’s guidance.  

**Example Prompts:**  
- *“Here are my notes on the water cycle. Identify the three most important points and one thing I might be missing.”*  
- *Senior level:* *“Here is my draft essay on climate change policy. Analyse the logical flow and point out where I make claims without evidence. Do not rewrite—just critique.”*

## ◆ Asking for Answers vs Asking for Guidance
▸ **Asking for Answers:**  
*"Solve this maths problem for me."*  
→ You get the solution, but you don’t learn.  

▸ **Asking for Guidance:**  
*"Explain how to solve this type of problem step by step, but let me do the calculations."*  
→ You learn the process, practise the skill, and build confidence.  

**The difference:** Asking for answers makes AI the student. Asking for guidance makes *you* the student.

## ◆ Final Note
This workflow is about building independence. Younger students can use it as a simple routine, while senior students can push further—using AI to test arguments, critique drafts, and strengthen their own voice.  

**AI guides. You decide.**
