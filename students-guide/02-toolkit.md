# Students’ Guide – Toolkit for Using AI in Learning  
**File: `students-guide/02-toolkit.md`**

---

## ◆ Introduction
AI can be a powerful study partner, but only if you use it wisely. Many students fall into the trap of simply asking for answers: *“What’s the solution?”* or *“Write my essay.”* This shortcut may finish the homework, but it weakens your learning.  

This toolkit shows you how to use AI to **understand, practise, and grow**. Each skill helps you stay in control of your learning, while AI acts as a compass pointing you in the right direction.

## ◆ The Four Literacy Skills

### ✦ 1. Diagnosis – Spotting Where You’re Stuck
**What it means:**  
Diagnosis is about recognising the exact part of the problem you don’t understand.  

**How to use it:**  
▸ Try to explain the problem in your own words.  
▸ Notice where you hesitate or feel confused—that’s the point to focus on.  
▸ Use AI to clarify *that specific part*, not the whole answer.  

**Example Prompt:**  
*"I don’t understand how to find the denominator in fractions. Explain it simply for a Grade 6 student."*

### ✦ 2. Decomposition – Breaking Tasks into Steps
**What it means:**  
Decomposition means splitting a big assignment into smaller, manageable steps.  

**How to use it:**  
▸ Break down the task: understand the question, review the concept, practise with examples, then attempt the full problem.  
▸ Ask AI to guide you step by step, but pause to do the work yourself before moving on.  

**Example Prompt:**  
*"Show me how to solve a long division problem step by step. Stop after each step so I can try before continuing."*

### ✦ 3. Prompt Engineering – Asking for Guidance, Not Answers
**What it means:**  
Prompt engineering is the skill of asking AI the *right kind of question*. Instead of *“Give me the answer,”* you ask for explanations, practice, or feedback.  

**How to use it:**  
▸ Frame prompts around learning goals: “Explain,” “Quiz me,” “Give examples.”  
▸ Avoid prompts that ask AI to “do the homework.”  
▸ Think of AI as a tutor sitting beside you, not a ghostwriter.  

**Example Prompt:**  
*"Act as a tutor. Ask me three practice questions about the water cycle. Wait for my answers before giving feedback."*

### ✦ 4. Critical Evaluation – Checking the Compass
**What it means:**  
Critical evaluation is about judging whether AI’s guidance is correct and useful. AI can sometimes be confidently wrong, so you must check.  

**How to use it:**  
▸ Compare AI’s explanation with your class notes or textbook.  
▸ Ask yourself: *Does this match what my teacher taught?*  
▸ Explain the idea back in your own words—if you can’t, you haven’t learned it yet.  

**Example Prompt:**  
*"Here is my short answer about photosynthesis. Tell me what is correct, and suggest one improvement I could make."*

## ◆ Asking for Answers vs Asking for Guidance
▸ **Asking for Answers:**  
*"Solve this maths problem for me."*  
→ You get the solution, but you don’t learn how to do it yourself.  

▸ **Asking for Guidance:**  
*"Explain how to solve this type of maths problem step by step, but let me do the calculations."*  
→ You learn the process, practise the skill, and build confidence.  

**The difference:** Asking for answers makes AI the student. Asking for guidance makes *you* the student.

## ◆ Final Note
This toolkit is about keeping you in control of your learning. Use AI to clarify, practise, and reflect—but always make sure the final work is yours.  

**AI guides. You decide.**
