# Parents’ Guide – Framework for Using AI in Learning  
**File: `parents-guide/02-framework.md`**

---

## ◆ Introduction
When helping children with homework, parents often feel two extremes: either confident in guiding the subject, or uncertain and “stuck.” Artificial Intelligence can be a helpful tool in both cases, but only if used wisely.  

This framework introduces **four simple skills** that parents can use to make AI a *learning compass* rather than a shortcut. Think of them as steps in a conversation with your child and the AI tool.

## ◆ The Four Literacy Skills

### ✦ 1. Diagnosis – Spotting the Stumbling Block
**What it means:**  
Diagnosis is about identifying *where* your child is struggling. Is it the vocabulary in a reading passage? The steps in a maths problem? Or the idea behind a science experiment?  

**How to do it:**  
▸ Ask your child to explain the problem in their own words.  
▸ Listen for the moment they hesitate or say “I don’t get this part.”  
▸ That hesitation is the *diagnosis point*.  

**Example Prompt for Parents:**  
*"My child is learning fractions. Explain the difference between numerator and denominator in simple terms for a Grade 4 student."*

### ✦ 2. Decomposition – Breaking It Down
**What it means:**  
Decomposition is about splitting a big task into smaller, manageable steps. Children often feel overwhelmed because they see the whole problem at once.  

**How to do it:**  
▸ Break the task into stages: understanding the question, reviewing the concept, practising with a simpler example, then tackling the full problem.  
▸ Use AI to provide step-by-step guidance, but pause after each step to check your child’s understanding.  

**Example Prompt for Parents:**  
*"Give me a step-by-step guide for solving a long division problem suitable for a Grade 5 student. Stop after each step so we can practise before moving on."*

### ✦ 3. Prompt Engineering – Asking for Help, Not Answers
**What it means:**  
Prompt engineering is simply the skill of *asking the right question*. Instead of “What’s the answer?”, parents can ask AI to *teach, explain, or quiz*.  

**How to do it:**  
▸ Frame prompts around learning goals: “Explain,” “Ask us questions,” “Give examples.”  
▸ Avoid prompts that ask AI to “do the homework.”  
▸ Think of AI as a tutor sitting at the table, not a ghostwriter.  

**Example Prompt for Parents:**  
*"Act as a tutor. Ask my child three practice questions about the water cycle. Wait for their answers before giving feedback."*

### ✦ 4. Critical Evaluation – Checking the Compass
**What it means:**  
Critical evaluation is about judging whether AI’s guidance is correct and useful. AI can sometimes be confidently wrong, so parents must act as the “sense-check.”  

**How to do it:**  
▸ Compare AI’s explanation with the textbook or class notes.  
▸ Ask your child to explain the idea back in their own words.  
▸ Encourage them to spot mistakes or gaps themselves.  

**Example Prompt for Parents:**  
*"Here is my child’s short answer about photosynthesis. Tell us what is correct, and suggest one improvement they could make."*

## ◆ Putting It All Together
When parents use these four skills, AI becomes a **compass for learning**:  
▸ **Diagnosis** finds the stumbling block.  
▸ **Decomposition** breaks the task into steps.  
▸ **Prompt Engineering** asks AI for guidance.  
▸ **Critical Evaluation** ensures the child’s own understanding.  

This process keeps the child in control of their learning, while parents act as supportive guides. It works across all subjects—maths, languages, science, history, and even creative arts.

## ◆ Final Note
Remember: **AI guides, but your child decides.**  
The framework is not about parents knowing every answer. It is about creating a safe, structured way to use AI so that children learn with confidence and independence.
