## ◆ Introduction
This playbook provides **ready-to-use example prompts** for parents. Each prompt is designed to:  
▸ Be simple and easy to execute.  
▸ Encourage back-and-forth engagement with your child.  
▸ Help break down concepts into manageable steps.  
▸ Keep the child active in the learning process.  

Remember: **AI is a compass, not a shortcut.** Use these prompts to guide understanding, not to replace your child’s thinking.

## ◆ Tips for Parents
◆ **Engage actively:** Don’t just read the AI’s response—pause, ask your child to explain, and discuss.  
◆ **Adapt prompts:** Change grade level, simplify language, or add examples to suit your child.  
◆ **Encourage reflection:** After each session, ask your child: *“What did you learn? Can you explain it without the AI?”*  
◆ **Keep it short:** Use prompts for small chunks of homework, not entire assignments.  

---

## ◆ Final Note
This playbook is not about giving children the answers. It is about **helping parents learn how to ask AI tools the right questions**, so that children practise, reflect, and grow.  

**AI guides. Your child decides.**
